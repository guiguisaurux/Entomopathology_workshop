This repository is used to store r code and data for analysis of mealworm (Tenebrio molitor L.) strain differences.

The three main experiments were first analysed using r, but issues with lme4 package turned us to JMP pro 18. 
Experimental results can be found in the folders "JMP_Experiment_1_analysis", "JMP_Experiment_2_analysis" and "JMP_Experiment_3_analysis"
R was used to create the different data tables that were then imported into JMP. 
Initial untransformed data can be explored on .txt files in the folder "Data" and code in "Scripts"
Many figures were generated and can be explored. Some figures are in .tif format and can be downloaded at will. 

It also contains the data and scripts of several experiments - most of which are pretests in forders "Data_désuets" and "Scripts_désuets".
