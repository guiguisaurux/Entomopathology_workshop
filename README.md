This repository is used to store r code and data for analysis of mealworm (<i>Tenebrio molitor</i> L.) strain differences.

The three main experiments were first analysed using r, but issues with lme4 package turned us to JMP pro 18. 
Experimental results can be found in the folders "JMP_Experiment_1_analysis", "JMP_Experiment_2_analysis" and "JMP_Experiment_3_analysis"
R was used to create the different data tables that were then imported into JMP. 
Initial untransformed data can be explored on .txt files in the folder "Data" and code in "Scripts"
Article figures can be downloaded in .tif format.

It also contains the data and scripts of several experiments - most of which are pretests in forders "Data_désuets" and "Scripts_désuets".
